** How it works
=memoriter= is a tool to help one memorize poems (or any lists).  

It consists of an iterative method explained by [[https://youtu.be/MuVhPN22IUs][Alexandre Soares Silva]], which follows these steps:
 * read and memorize the first line of the poem;
 * hide the poem and try to recall that line;
 * if successfully recalled,
   * read and memorize the first two lines;
   * hide the poem and try to recall those two lines;
     * if successully recalled,
       * read and memorize the first three lines;
       * etc.  
 * if failed, return to the beginning and try again.  
   
** Basic Usage
In the terminal, type: 
 * =python3 memoriter [poem_file]= to memorize [poem_file];
 * =python3 memoriter -h= to print help. 
   
** Usage example
1. Download this repository; or, from a terminal, install =git= and clone this repository with =$ git clone https://github.com/filipecfv/memoriter=;

2. In the =memoriter= directory, run =python3 memoriter poems/Pope_Epigram.txt= on the terminal to memorize Alexander Pope's Epigram;

*** Notes on memorizing:
 * By default, =memoriter= will require you to recall /every single/ character of the poem (with the exception of outer spaces), including all sorts of punctuation, such as commas and periods.
 * Therefore, the reason why =memoriter= may say you failed to recall /Sir, I admit your general rule,/ may lie in answering /Sir, I admit your general rule/: sometimes a comma means a lot.   

*** Notes on adding poems: 
 * The =poems/= directory contains other examples of poems for testing; 
 * To add a poem to the collection, you only need a plain text file with its lines (do not include its author and/or title if you don't want to memorize them);
 * By default, =memoriter= will read the positional argument (i.e., the command right after =memoriter=) as the file present in the same repository from which you call it or as the path to the file. Thus, if your =poem.txt= were in the same folder as =memoriter=, it would be enough to type =python3 memoriter poem.txt=, while if it were in =my_library/=, you should pass the full path from the directory where you are running =memoriter=, i.e., =python3 memoriter my_library/poem.txt=.

** The name
=memoriter= is the recursive acronym of =memoriter morās iterat=:
